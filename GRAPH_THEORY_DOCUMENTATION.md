# Graph Theory Implementation in Educational Game

## Overview

This educational game uses **graph theory** to create a dynamic, choice-driven narrative system where player decisions influence future available options. The implementation creates a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** that represents the story flow and choice dependencies.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Story Graph Structure

The game's narrative is modeled as a **directed graph** where:
- **Nodes** represent story steps/questions
- **Edges** represent player choices that connect story steps
- **Edge weights** represent the impact on player stats (personal state, social relations)

```typescript
interface StoryNode {
  id: string;           // Unique identifier (e.g., "FACULTY_STEP_1")
  text: string;         // Story content
  situation?: string;   // Context description
  sceneId: string;      // Which scene this belongs to
  stepIndex: number;    // Position within the scene
  allChoices: Choice[]; // All possible choices for this step
}

interface ChoiceEdge {
  id: string;           // Same as choice.id
  fromNode: string;     // Source story step
  toNode: string;       // Destination story step
  choice: Choice;       // The actual choice data
  blocks: string[];     // Which future choice IDs this edge blocks
}
```

### 2. Graph Traversal and State Management

The game engine maintains a **current node** and tracks player state through:
- **Stat changes** from each choice
- **Choice blocking** to prevent invalid paths
- **Dynamic path generation** based on current state

```typescript
class StoryGraph {
  private nodes: Map<string, StoryNode>;
  private edges: Map<string, ChoiceEdge>;
  private adjacencyList: Map<string, string[]>;

  constructor() {
    this.nodes = new Map();
    this.edges = new Map();
    this.adjacencyList = new Map();
  }

  addNode(node: StoryNode): void {
    this.nodes.set(node.id, node);
  }

  addEdge(edge: ChoiceEdge): void {
    this.edges.set(edge.id, edge);
    if (!this.adjacencyList.has(edge.fromNode)) {
      this.adjacencyList.set(edge.fromNode, []);
    }
    this.adjacencyList.get(edge.fromNode)!.push(edge.toNode);
  }

  getAvailableChoices(currentNodeId: string): Choice[] {
    const currentNode = this.nodes.get(currentNodeId);
    if (!currentNode) return [];
    
    return currentNode.allChoices.filter(choice => {
      const edge = this.edges.get(choice.id);
      return !edge || !this.isBlocked(edge.blocks);
    });
  }

  private isBlocked(blockedIds: string[]): boolean {
    // Implementation would check if any blocked choices are currently active
    return false;
  }
}
```

### 3. Diagram Schema

```
[START] --> (Choice A) --> [Node 1]
            |
            |---> (Choice B) --> [Node 2]
            |
            |---> (Choice C) --> [Node 3]

[Node 1] --> (Choice D) --> [Node 4]
           |
           |---> (Choice E) --> [Node 5]

[Node 2] --> (Choice F) --> [Node 6]
           |
           |---> (Choice G) --> [Node 7]

[Node 3] --> (Choice H) --> [Node 8]
           |
           |---> (Choice I) --> [Node 9]
```

Each node represents a story step with multiple choice options, and edges represent valid transitions between story steps based on player decisions and state constraints.

### 4. Complete Game Flow Example

Here's how the game flow works from start to finish:

1. **Initialization**: Game loads initial story nodes and choice edges
2. **Player Interaction**: Player selects a choice from available options
3. **State Update**: Game processes choice effects on player stats
4. **Path Restriction**: Blocked choices are removed from future options
5. **Next Step**: New available choices are presented to player
6. **Loop**: Steps 2-5 repeat until end of story path

Example flow:
- Player starts at [START] node
- Chooses "Choice A" â†’ moves to [Node 1]
- At [Node 1], player sees choices D and E
- If player chooses D, they go to [Node 4]
- If player chooses E, they go to [Node 5]
- Each choice may block certain future paths
- Game continues until no more choices are available
